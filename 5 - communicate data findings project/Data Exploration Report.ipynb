This made the shape of the distribution more visible and aesthetically pleasing. The histograms were accompanied by vertical lines denoting the maximum and minimum values in teh distribution.    \n",

    "- Unique carrier was dsiplayed using a horisontal barchart of the carrier value counts in ascending order.   \n",
    "- Only the top 20 Origin and Destination airport were explored. These were displayed programmatically and visually on a rendered map of the United States to show their actual location using coordinates from the IATA Airport dictionary and map display tool Mapbox.   \n",

    "- 15 day rolling window linecharts of mean and total delay per delay cause for the year 2008 were shown next. The trends of total carrier, national air service and late aircraft delays follow the same pattern as the mean arrival delay for the duration of 2008. Late aircraft delay has the highest mean duration for most of 2008. Carrier delay does not follow the general trends of the other two causes. \n",
    "- 15 minute rolling average delay duration per cause for 24 hours was displayed using a linechart, showing carrier delay as the major delay from 6am to 11am and late aircraft being the major delay thereafter. \n",
